Description
--------------

CleanCompare removes stats that aren't relevant for your current class
and specialization from the stat change summaries in item comparison
tooltips.

It currently does not support offspecs, or any kind of rating-to-percent
conversions; it is intended as a lightweight alternative to RatingBuster
for leveling characters and casual players.


Feedback
-----------

**Post a comment on WoWInterface.** If you are reporting a bug, please
include detailed instructions I can follow to reproduce the bug myself,
whether or not it still happens when all other addons are disabled, and
the exact text of the first related error message (if any) from BugSack.

If you need to contact me privately, you can send a private message to
Phanx on either download site, or email me at <addons@phanx.net>.
**Please note** that I do not provide private addon support or tutoring
of any kind; post a comment or forum thread instead!
