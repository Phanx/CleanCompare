CleanCompare
===============

CleanCompare removes stats that aren't relevant for your current class
and specialization from the stat change summaries in item comparison
tooltips.

It currently does not support offspecs, or any kind of rating-to-percent
conversions; it is intended as a lightweight alternative to RatingBuster
for leveling characters and casual players.
