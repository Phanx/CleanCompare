CleanCompare
===============

Removes stats that aren't relevant for your current class and specialization from the summary of changes in item comparison tooltips.

It currently does not support offspecs, and will never do any kind of rating-to-percent conversions; it is intended as a lightweight alternative to RatingBuster for leveling characters and casual players.
